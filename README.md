## Instructions

Basically this is my first complete project using some HTML and CSS styling in addition to JavaScript to display a version of a Landing Page.

I converted the project from a static project to an interactive(dynamaically built) one.

The page has 5 sections and a navigation bar built dynamically as an unordered list using JavaScript.
I created a function to link the clicked section on the navigation bar to its
corresponding section, leaving the header of the section in addition to the section on the navigation
bar highlighted to know which section is being viewed while scrolling through the page.

Using .getBoundingClientRect() built-in function, .addEventListener on click and scroll,
the link scroll to the appropriate section when clicking on the section from the
navigation bar or scrolling to the section immediately.

The layout of the page was created responsively to be used across all devices.

Comments were added before each line code to ease the process of reading and understanding the code.
